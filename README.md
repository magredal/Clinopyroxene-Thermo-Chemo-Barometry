# Enhancing Machine Learning Thermobarometry for Clinopyroxene-Bearing Magmas
Hello and welcome!

This is the series of codes used to calibrate and test the different results from the enhanced clinopyroxene (cpx) and clinoyroxene-liquid (cpx-liq) thermo-barometers presented in Ágreda-López et al. (2024) submitted to Computers and Geosciences journal.

 You will find three .zip files.  Select the one that better fits your needs:

1. ML_PT_Pyworkflow: contains all you need to use our Python module directly and get your P and T estimates.
2. Web app: contains all files used to build our Web app. You can directly access to the app without having to download anything clicking here: LINK
3. All_scripts: contains all the scripts we used in the manuscript "Enhancing Machine Learning Thermobarometry for Clinopyroxene-Bearing Magmas", submitted to the Computers and Geosciences journal.
